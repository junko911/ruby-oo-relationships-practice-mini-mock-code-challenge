Overall Assessment: 2.5/5


Additional Comments:

This could easily have been a 4 out of 5 or high but there were some mistakes. Since this has been updated to a many to many association, the `Book` class should no longer initialize with an instance of `Author` because it no longer belongs to an author. This also means that your `author.write_book` method is incorrect as well. I can tell that you understand single source of truth and you have correctly built your join model. Your mistakes seem like they could just be oversights so just be very careful that you are testing your code and paying attention to details. 

Go ahead and look over your code, spot as many of the mistakes as you can and the resubmit your work so I can take another look.

Muuuuuuuch better. Make sure you understand the differences between what you had before and this new solution. Good job!
